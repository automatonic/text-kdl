# Railroad Diagrams

`kdl-2-0.ebnf`

This file is a simplification of the [v2.0 spec for KDL](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl/blob/main/SPEC.md) as adapted purely for the creation of approximated railroad diagrams (via this handy [application](https://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui)).

> Largely this was adapted by summarizing certain "reg-ex" like formulations of rules as production rules with names that simply describe the resulting character classes. These rules, then left undefined in the grammar, display an intelligible intuition of what the grammar will do. For full details, one should carefully review the official spec.

The resulting generated html is [here](kdl-2.0-railroad-diagrams/kdl-2.0-railroad-diagrams.md).
