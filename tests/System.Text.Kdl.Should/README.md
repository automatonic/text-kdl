# Should
Both the test assembly and the classes themselves use a "Should" suffix. This adds a fluent suggestion that these tests define specifications of how a class should operate. 

# Verify
Tests will use the Verify package by Simon Cropp to tightly control what is valid across complex hierarchies.

# Xunit (V3)
We are using the newest incarnation of Xunit, both to learn the ropes of this new approach, and to benefit from the new features incoming. 

This also seems to align with how MSUnit is moving, so it is likely worth testing the waters.
